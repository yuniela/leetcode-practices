# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
# Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
# The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

# Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
# Output: [1]
# Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
# The result of the merge is [1].

# Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
# Output: [1]
# Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
# The result of the merge is [1].
# Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
